  "description": "In this tutorial, we create a simple web app, which invites people to search for locations and to store them in their browsersâ€™ localStorage. The locations are presented on a Google Map with the help of the GMaps plugin. We use Bootstrap with the Flatly theme for the interface. In the process, we break the application down into logical components and make them talk to each other.",
